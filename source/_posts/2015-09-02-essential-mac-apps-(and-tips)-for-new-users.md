If like me, you’re a developer and you finally decided to switch to Mac then trust me you did the right choice but, you’re likely searching for those cool Apps that you’ve seen in your twitter feed, you was amazed with what they can do, but you just ignored them thinking `”One day when I’ll have a Mac”`. Well that day is finally here And I’ll save you the hassle of going through your feed searching because they are probably listed here.

In this article I’ll introduce you to some Apps/Tools that I found useful. Some of them are free but others are paid and I’ll try to present some alternatives when available.

## Apps & Tools

![img](/assets/images/resources/mac/icons/iTerm.png){.mac-app-icon}

[iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/){.mac-app-title target=_blank}

In my opinion the thing number one that you should make pretty and powerful is the Terminal. iTerm is a replacement for the native OSx Terminal. It comes with a lot of great features. Coupled with [Tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) & [oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) you can unleash your repressed powers.

I highly recommend you checking this [article](http://arkhamdev.github.io/tools/2014/12/20/iterm-vim-and-tmux.html) by [Badr Chouai](http://www.twitter.com/arkhamdev) on ***iTerm, Vim and Tmux*** and this [book](https://pragprog.com/book/bhtmux/tmux) for Tmux.

***`Alternatives:`*** [Atom](https://atom.io/)

Well Hazel is every flexible app that does just that.


### Built-in Stuff that you should make use of

One of the great things about Mac is it has a lot of native apps that are fantastic. I’ll compile a list of great tools that will make your life easier.


#### - Activity Monitor

Well like his name says, it helps you monitor your mac, see who does what.

#### - Force quite application

If your coming from Windows then you must be very familiar with the famous Alt+Ctrl+Del, well here’s it sister.

#### - Reminders
Huh! For reminders?

#### - Calendar
Really helpful for managing appointments, holidays and related stuff.

#### - Calculator
Yeah, you never knew.

#### - Dictionary
This! is a very helpful app folks, I use in two ways:

- In the Spotlight (or Alferer) I write *Define {My-word}*.
- While reading something in *any* app, I select the world then hit `ctrl+cmd+D a nice tooltip appears with the word's definition.

#### - Mail
Very great Desktop mail client that works with pretty much any email service provider.

#### - Spotlight
Think of it as the native *Alferd*.

#### - Disk Utility
This you have just to know that it exists, for Hard drive manipulations. Be very carful when working with it.

#### - Previewer (for PDF stuff)
Up to now, I didn’t found a better PDF reader.

## Tips

### Personalize the finder
Again if you’re coming form Windows, **Finder** can be really frustrating. You hit *Enter* it renames, you hit *Back space* nothing happens.  What if you wants to go back 2 steps behind? what if you want to go somewhere by path?

Here are some short cuts & customiztion that will make your interactions with finder less stressful.

#### - Hotkeys

- Ctrl+⬇︎ enter the selected folder.
- Ctrl+⬆︎ Back to the parent folder.
- Ctrl+Back space, to move something to the trash
- Ctrl+shift+g, Go to any folder by path.

#### - Customization

In the menu:

- *Finder > Preferences > Advanced*

    - [Checked] Show all filename extensions
	- [Uncheck] Show warning before changing an extension

- *View > Show Path bar*
- *View > Show tab bar*

PS: There’s an app called [x] there personalize the finder, but I like to stick to the native one in this case.


### Personalize Doker
The Dock is something that you will be interacting with a lot, so make sure to making it behaves and looks as you expect.

#### - Disable Genie effect:

Come’on we are not in an Aladin movie, disable the damn thing, it kills performance. You can do that by going to *System preference > Dock > Minimize windows using > Scale effect*.

#### - Add space separators:

Wouldn’t be great if you could group icons by function? well you can add spaces as separators using the command line.

Open Teminal && copy this
```.language-powershell
defaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array-add ‘{“tile-type”=“spacer-tile”;}’ && killall Dock
```
That will add a space (that you can drag and drop as a normal icon) and close the Dock so changes can take place.

Here’s mine

### Toolbar related stuff
Quick tip here, you can rearrange the Toolbar icons by maintaining ctrl and moving them where you want.

### Stuff that they won’t tell you if you’re coming form Windows
App (by that I mean files with .app extension) within the ‘Applications’ directory are actually … well real folder not like .exe file like you would expect if you’re coming form Windows. Right click any app and chose *Show package contents* to check that out.

Why you should know this? I don’t know, I thought it would be cool.

### A better control key

This one is not related to Mac. Well the Tip is to change the *Caps lock* key to *Ctrl*. You may have tow questions, first **Why the heck I would do this?** the response is it’s more easier to hit *Caps lock* that *Ctrl* it require less effort and Second you may ask **and where the *Caps Lock* will goes?** Think of it, do you really use it for something. 99% of the time you’re probably using *shift*.

### Super corners

There’s a very cool feature in OSx that let you set custom events when you move your cursor to one of the four corners of the screen. You can play with it in *System preference > Mission  Control > Hot Corners (at the bottom)*.

### Dragging tip

When I saw the *Three fingers Drag* of the trackpad I said, “Hell no! Dragging with one finger is no fun and now let do it with 3! Crap!” but it turns out it's a very great feature and the guy who design it deserves all our deepest respect.

Now! Go active the damn feature and head to this very well explained [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf2JsstwAA0) and thank me later.

### Bonus tips

- If you have a Retina MBP it generally heats more that the normal ones so don’t panic if it heats a little bit. I generally advise to buy a cooler.

- Try to clean it at least one time per month.

- Keep the charger plugged in when you're working for long periods.

## Closing

Well folks, that’s it, I hope you found this article useful and let’s keep it running in the comments section, share with us your cool tricks.

They didn’t lied when they said:

> Once you go Mac, There’s no going back!
