Have you ever been in a situation where you were expected to quickly understand what the other part is saying?

Well, it happens to me quite often, where I’m in the middle of a conversation with one of my friends or colleagues, I notice that they are expecting me to understand what they are saying quickly and they get mad if I don’t. The problem is that it usually makes things even harder for me to understand because this time instead of trying to understand what they are saying, I'm now afraid of not understanding in time.

I also noticed that this behavior usually pushes people to pretend that they understood what you're saying even if they don’t, because they’re afraid of that reaction.

Now, I become aware of that, now, whenever I don't understand something, I say so, and so what? it's not the end of the world! Even if the other part is expecting me to quickly read their minds and God knows what.

As a result of my new behavior a lot of people started to tell me that my understanding process is slow, I usually laugh at it, because it doesn't mater how long, what matters is to get it. Besides that I’m also constantly improving how I learn things and more importantly, ***how to explain myself***, and that what led me to an interesting observation: `Sometimes a lot of people don't know how to explain their ideas and therefore they think that others can't understand them.`

So please, next time, be patient and explain your ideas well, and if you do, and the other part still can't get it, give them the time, explain it differently because trust me, one day you will be on the other side of that conversation.
